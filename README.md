This repository is a class example used to gain
experience with source control and TypeScript.

## Getting started

### Installing TypeScript
- Download and install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- In the command line run `npm install -g typescript`. Note: "typescript" is case sensitive.

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, run the following command: `tsc --watch`. Using the watch option only requires us to compile once each time the project is opened.
